Just download whole folders (Legit and/or HvH) or click on the config and download single files u want to try.

After download is finished put the .cfg file in -->  C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\RANDOM_NAMED_FOLDER\RANDOM_NAMED_FOLDER 

Then go back into Game, refresh Configlist, choose the Config and press load.
Now have fun :D
